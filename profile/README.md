#### 📊 Your Data, Forever Accessible

AthenaX uses IPFS to ensure everything that matters—hackathon projects, research, and X analytics—stays accessible, verifiable, and owned by the people who create it.

#### 🔗 One Stack, Four Products

- **HackX** (Build): Open-source hackathons with projects, teams, and demos stored on IPFS
- **ScholarX** (Research): Direct publishing with datasets, peer review, and version control
- **AnalyticsX** (Analyze): Free X performance tracking with permanently preserved metrics
- **LaunchX** (Scale): Transparent accelerator with on-chain-style audibility via IPFS

#### 🏛️ Backed by NounsDAO

AthenaX is an open-source data layer backed by [NounsDAO](https://x.com/nounsdao), ensuring community ownership and governance.

#### 🔓 The Open Data Promise

Everything in AthenaX—builds, papers, metrics—lives permanently on IPFS. No deletions. No gatekeepers. We're building permanent infrastructure for human knowledge.
