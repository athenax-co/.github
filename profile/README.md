# Welcome to AthenaX

**Our mission is to build permanent infrastructure for human knowledge and innovation.**

We empower communities of builders, researchers, and analysts to connect and create the future of open data.

## What is AthenaX?

AthenaX is an open-source data layer backed by NounsDAO, building tools to permanently store and make accessible the world's knowledge. We use IPFS to ensure hackathon projects, research papers, and analytics data remain forever accessible, verifiable, and owned by their creators.

## Your Data, Forever Accessible

AthenaX ensures everything that matters stays permanently stored on IPFS. No deletions. No gatekeepers. True data ownership.

#### üîó One Stack, Four Products

- **HackX** (Build): Open-source hackathons with projects, teams, and demos stored on IPFS
- **ScholarX** (Research): Direct publishing with datasets, peer review, and version control
- **AnalyticsX** (Analyze): Free X performance tracking with permanently preserved metrics
- **LaunchX** (Scale): Transparent accelerator with on-chain-style audibility via IPFS

## Backed by NounsDAO

AthenaX is proudly backed by [NounsDAO](https://x.com/nounsdao), ensuring community ownership, governance, and alignment with public goods.

## The Open Data Promise

Everything in AthenaX‚Äîbuilds, papers, metrics‚Äîlives permanently on IPFS. We're not just building tools. We're building permanent infrastructure for human knowledge.

## Building on AthenaX Protocols

### HackX Protocol
The HackX protocol enables decentralized hackathon infrastructure. Communities can host, judge, and fund hackathons with full transparency.

**Getting Started:**
- Documentation *(Coming Soon)*
- API Reference *(Coming Soon)*
- Smart Contracts *(In Development)*

### ScholarX Protocol
ScholarX provides decentralized research publishing infrastructure with permanent storage and version control.

**Resources:**
- Publishing Guide *(Coming Soon)*
- Peer Review System *(Coming Soon)*
- Citation Standards *(Coming Soon)*

## Repos

Our codebase is being actively developed. All repositories will be open-sourced upon release:

* **hackx-platform** - Open-source hackathon platform *(Coming Soon)*
* **scholarx-core** - Decentralized research publishing *(Coming Soon)*
* **analyticsx-engine** - X analytics tracking system *(Coming Soon)*
* **launchx-accelerator** - Transparent accelerator platform *(Coming Soon)*

> We're currently building in public. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TkKH8rXX) to follow development progress!

## Current Initiative: HackX Buildathon

We're running the [HackX Buildathon](https://hackquest.io/hackathons/HackX-Buildathon) where developers are building the first open-source Web3 hackathon platform from scratch. 

**Why this matters:** Instead of relying on closed platforms, we're creating community-owned infrastructure that connects elite developers directly with emerging L1/L2 ecosystems - "made by devs, for devs & ecosystems."

**Co-hosted by:** [@athenax_co](https://x.com/athenax_co) & [@nounsdao](https://x.com/nounsdao)
