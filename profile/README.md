#### Your Data, Forever Accessible

AthenaX uses IPFS to ensure everything that matters‚Äîhackathon projects, research, and X analytics‚Äîstays accessible, verifiable, and owned by the people who create it.

#### One Stack, Four Products

- **HackX** (Build): Open-source hackathons with projects, teams, and demos stored on IPFS
- **ScholarX** (Research): Direct publishing with datasets, peer review, and version control
- **AnalyticsX** (Analyze): Free X performance tracking with permanently preserved metrics
- **LaunchX** (Scale): Transparent accelerator with on-chain-style audibility via IPFS

#### Backed by NounsDAO

AthenaX is an open-source data layer backed by [NounsDAO](https://x.com/nounsdao), ensuring community ownership and governance.

#### The Open Data Promise

Everything in AthenaX‚Äîbuilds, papers, metrics‚Äîlives permanently on IPFS. No deletions. No gatekeepers. We're building permanent infrastructure for human knowledge.
