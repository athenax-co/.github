# Welcome to AthenaX

**Our mission is to build permanent infrastructure for human knowledge and innovation.**

We empower communities of builders, researchers, and analysts to connect and create the future of open data.

## What is AthenaX?

AthenaX is an open-source data layer backed by NounsDAO, building tools to permanently store and make accessible the world's knowledge. We leverage IPFS to ensure all builder dataâ€”from hackathon projects to research papers to X analyticsâ€”remains permanently accessible, verifiable, and owned by their creators.

## Your Data, Forever Accessible

AthenaX ensures everything that matters stays permanently stored on IPFS. No deletions. No gatekeepers. True data ownership.

## The Problem We're Solving

- **Hackathon innovations disappear** after events end
- **Research gets trapped** behind paywalls or lost when platforms shut down
- **X analytics tools charge excessive fees** for basic insights
- **Valuable data and insights have no permanent**, accessible home

## Our Solution: One Stack, Four Products

**Key Features:** Permanent project records, builder reputation system, team discovery, organizer tools

### 2. ScholarX â†’ Research
Decentralized research publishing platform with complete IPFS storage.

**Stored on IPFS:**
- Research articles and papers
- Datasets and supplementary materials
- Peer review comments
- Author profiles and credentials

- **Content Creators:** Prove your X growth with permanent, verifiable analytics
- **Investors:** Verify founder claims about their social media influence and growth

## The Open Data Promise

Everything in AthenaXâ€”builds, papers, metricsâ€”lives permanently on IPFS. We're not just building tools. We're building permanent infrastructure for human knowledge.

## Building on AthenaX Protocols

### HackX Protocol
The HackX protocol enables decentralized hackathon infrastructure. Communities can host, judge, and fund hackathons with full transparency.

**Getting Started:**
- Documentation *(Coming Soon)*
- API Reference *(Coming Soon)*
- Smart Contracts *(In Development)*

### ScholarX Protocol
ScholarX provides decentralized research publishing infrastructure with permanent storage and version control.

**Resources:**
- Publishing Guide *(Coming Soon)*
- Peer Review System *(Coming Soon)*
- Citation Standards *(Coming Soon)*

## Repos

Our codebase is being actively developed. All repositories will be open-sourced upon release:

* **hackx-platform** - Open-source hackathon platform *(Coming Soon)*
* **scholarx-core** - Decentralized research publishing *(Coming Soon)*
* **analyticsx-engine** - X analytics tracking system *(Coming Soon)*
* **launchx-accelerator** - Transparent accelerator platform *(Coming Soon)*

> We're currently building in public. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/TkKH8rXX) to follow development progress!

## Current Initiative: HackX Buildathon

We're running the [HackX Buildathon](https://hackquest.io/hackathons/HackX-Buildathon) where developers are building the first open-source Web3 hackathon platform from scratch.

**Why this matters:** Instead of relying on closed platforms, we're creating community-owned infrastructure that connects elite developers directly with emerging L1/L2 ecosystems - "made by devs, for devs & ecosystems."

**Co-hosted by:** [@athenax_co](https://x.com/athenax_co) & [@nounsdao](https://x.com/nounsdao)

## Roadmap

- **Q3 2025:** HackX launch
- **Q4 2025:** ScholarX release
- **Q1 2026:** AnalyticsX deployment
- **Q2 2026:** LaunchX first cohort
- **Q3 2026:** Full ecosystem integration
- **2027:** Community governance

## Business Model

Core infrastructure remains open source. Revenue through:
- Enterprise support and deployments
- Advanced analytics features
- LaunchX program participation
- Custom integrations
